The code implements a car park management system that allows users to park cars, remove cars, display parked cars, and save/load car park data.      
It utilizes a linked list to store car information and provides functions for various operations such as calculating parking time and fees.                   
Additionally, it includes a header file that encapsulates the functionality of the system for use in other source files.
